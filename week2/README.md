# 🐸 Week 2: Frog Leap Problem

This week’s task was to design a Python game called **“Frog Leap”**, where logic and strategy are combined to create a simple but engaging puzzle.  
The project demonstrates problem-solving, programming fundamentals, and clear game logic in Python.

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a Python-based puzzle game that challenges the player to move frogs across positions while following specific movement rules.  
The focus is on:
- Applying structured programming concepts  
- Implementing rules-based game logic  
- Providing an interactive and enjoyable user experience

## 🕹️ Game Rules
- Frogs on the **left** can only move towards the right.  
- Frogs on the **right** can only move towards the left.  
- A frog may **move one step** into an empty space, or **jump over one frog** into the next empty space.
