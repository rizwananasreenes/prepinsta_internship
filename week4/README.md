# Week 4 — World Bank Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Overview
In Week 4, the focus was on completing the data integration and producing the animated visualization inspired by Hans Rosling’s TED talk *“The best stats you’ve ever seen”*.  

This week builds on Week 3 by finalizing the cleaning steps, merging datasets, and generating both **static plots** and an **animated scatter plot**.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
1. **Data Integration**
   - Merged Life Expectancy, Fertility Rate, and Population datasets.
   - Added Region and Income Group metadata.

2. **Visualization**
   - Produced static scatter plots (Life Expectancy vs Fertility Rate).
   - Created animated scatter plot:
     - **X-axis**: Fertility Rate  
     - **Y-axis**: Life Expectancy  
     - **Bubble size**: Population  
     - **Color**: Region (with legend)

   - Exported animation to `.mp4` for sharing.
